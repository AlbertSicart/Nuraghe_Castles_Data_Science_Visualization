# Nuraghe_Castles_Data_Science_Visualization
This project offers an in-depth analysis and visualization of archaeological sites in Sardinia using Python and the Folium library.

Overview:
Data on nearly 8,000 archaeological sites in Sardinia, encompassing a wide variety of categories like Nuraghe, Menhir, Dolmen, etc., serves as the foundation for this project. The primary objective is to unearth patterns and insights through geospatial visualization techniques.

Features:
Interactive Maps: Utilize Folium to create interactive maps that allow users to zoom, pan, and click on markers for more details.

Marker Clustering: With the vast amount of data, marker clusters are employed to enhance visualization, enabling users to identify areas with higher concentrations of sites.

Heatmaps: These visualize the density of archaeological sites, further assisting in highlighting regions of particular archaeological interest. Different heatmaps for specific site categories, such as Nuraghe and non-Nuraghe, are generated to cater to specific interests.

Color Coding: Sites are distinctly color-coded based on their type, making it easier for users to identify and differentiate between them.

Water Proximity Analysis: Investigate the concentration of archaeological sites in relation to geographical features, particularly their proximity to different water bodies like coastlines, rivers, and lakes.

Altitude Correlation Study: This section studies the potential correlation between the altitude of the sites and their types, and proximity to water bodies.

Skills Demonstrated:
Geospatial Visualization: Advanced skills in crafting insightful and interactive geospatial visualizations using Folium.

Data Analysis: Conducting correlation studies and exploratory data analysis using pandas to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

Python Programming: Efficiently processing and visualizing a vast dataset using Python.
